                <h2>CompEdu M.V.P. launch:</h2>

                <p> CompEdu is a product that fellow intern Dylan Rafferty and I have been paired to and working on for the 
                past few weeks. CompoZed Northland currently has a products board which contains product information such 
                as name, team members, technologies used, testing stack etc. for each product in the lab. This board was very 
                rarely updated and this combined with the inconsistent written format made it difficult to use. We were 
                tasked with digitising this board.<br><br>

                We discovered that developers tried to use this board to find out who had experience with a certain 
                technology they were unfamiliar with and needed help with. However, the fact that the board was out of date 
                meant they lost time asking several people before coming to someone who could help them. We provided a 
                solution to this problem which will bring a lot of value to the company. <br><br>

                I have been heavily involved in this product from the very beginning. We chose to code this product in React because of the testing 
                capabilities and the UI libraries it offers. Neither of us had any experience using React but despite this I took it from the early scoping
                 and inception stages right through to Minimum Viable Product (M.V.P.). We will be further expanding on it post M.V.P. by adding
                  additional features. We used a MSSQL database to store our data and an interesting point about React JS is that while it can 
                  access databases from the client side, it's not easily done and creates security issues. To circumvent this, we decided to 
                  split our app into two separate applications; a server side and client side. The server side is an Express application which 
                  serves the client side React app using Ajax calls. API to handle the calls between them. This was an excellent learning experience. 
                  We officially launched this product for use in the Belfast and Northland labs on Friday 25th of August and this was something I was 
                  extremely looking forward to. I presented the Minimum Viable Product (M.V.P) to the lab, received feedback on it and answered questions.
                   The product will also be added to the CompoZed docs and the CompoZed Allstate website in the coming weeks.<br><br>

                This has been the highlight of my Allstate placement so far. Being able to say that I have created
                this product from scratch and the lab will now use it to aid my colleagues is a major personal achievement 
                for me.

                <h2>Highest G.P.A:</h2>
                <p>I received a letter from the Head of the LYIT Computing department congratulating me on earning the highest 
                G.P.A. across my class year group for the first semester of my course. (Second semester highest G.P.A. 
                has not yet been released).
                </p>
                <h2> Highest mark in Computer Architecture: </h2>
                <p>I was informed by my lecturer that I received the highest mark in the entire year for Computer Architecture 
                in the second semester. He complimented me on this as this is a difficult thing to achieve considering we 
                had to submit practical lab reports and quizzes weekly and end of semester exams for this subject making 
                the workload very high. The material is also hard for most students to get their heads around.
                </p>
                <h2>Top scorer in Bursary interviews:</h2>
                <p>Last year I was interviewed for a bursary scheme to encourage more females to get into computing. This scheme
                was supported by Allstate and several other companies. One of the interviewers on the day was CompoZed Global Lab Director
                 - Gina O'Leary. Not only was I accepted for this bursary but Gina recently informed me that I was the 
                top scorer in the interviews.
                </p>
                <h2>Javascipt and ReactJS learnings:</h2>
                <p>I have completed 2 courses on Codecademy since starting in Allstate. One of these was a Javascript course and 
                    the other was in ReactJS. I have also made use of the Pluralsight tutorials and written the CompEdu product 
                    using React. 
                </p>
