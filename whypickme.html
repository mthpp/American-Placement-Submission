            <h2> Why should you pick me? </h2>

            <h3>We Value Each Other / We win together:</h3>
            <p>I have been engaged in paired programming with the other CompoZed intern; Dylan Rafferty and this has been useful as I
                was able to share my knowledge of HTML and CSS with him and he shared his knowledge of databases with me. In general, everyone 
                 in the lab has been extremely helpful whenever I have questioned them about something, which I try to make a habit of to take 
                 advantage of the highly skilled developers around me. </p>
            <h3>We Value Freedom of Action / We're here to serve:</h3>
            <p> We are given the freedom in CompoZed to pick our preferred technology to code our products. This is important to me as it gives me the 
                ability to choose a technology I'm unfamiliar with and research how to implement it which furthers my learning. I have also found the 
                paired programming environment very beneficial. This method of programming really encourages sharing of knowledge between partners.
                Some additional projects I have taken on are; learning to code in Python in my spare time and volunteering to teach primary school children
                 programming for a day at my college last year which was really satisfying.
            </p>
            <h3>We Value Agility with Purpose / We're transparent:</h3>
            <p>I have really embraced the agile principles and the ideas behind Extreme Programming. I have been greatly successful in working on multiple 
                stories (tasks) related to our product which were broken down into more manageable pieces to maximise productivity and increase
                transparency. In addition, I have gained experience in Test Driven Development which CompoZed uses to write better code by encouraging the
                 developers to think more about what they're doing before they get started.</p>
            <h3> We Value Being Change Catalysts / We get continuously better:</h3>
            <p>I often make a point of asking questions. I find that curiosity and an inquisitive nature are some of the best traits to have in this
                industry. I frequently contribute at our morning standup meetings and retros to get my points across. I would also like to 
                mention that while learning the new technologies I have been exposed to here at Allstate, I have been using my free time to continue 
                coding in Java to keep this knowledge fresh for when I go back to college.</p>
            <h3>We Value Leaving Things Better Than We Found Them / We drive results:</h3>
            <p>CompEdu will be launched on Friday September 25th. This product will be available after I leave the lab and will be really helpful to the 
                people currently working in the lab. I have 3 weeks of this internship remaining and given that we have completed our M.V.P., we
                will start adding additional features to the product next week. Still working on Java on Codewars to keep it fresh over the summer.</p>
