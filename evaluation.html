            <h2> Evaluation of this submission project: </h2>

            <p>Although it was brilliant to be allowed to apply for this placement having missed
                the original deadline, I feel like I would have benefited immensely from the extra time. It was
                difficult to manage putting together this application and preparing to launch our M.V.P. (Minimum Viable Product) in a 
                short time period. However, this was a worthwhile project.
            </p>

            <h3> Things I would improve next time: </h3>
            <p>
                Under more flexible time constraints I would have used the Bootstrap framework to implement a grid system and make
                the styling of this website more efficient. Bootstrap is also usfeul for incorporating responsive design. I am more familiar 
                with CSS but I would have enjoyed learning more about how to implement Bootstrap styles. Initially I experimented with using 
                the modern flex box system to style the pages but this wasn't a viable option because of the positioning of some of the page 
                components. 
            </p>                
            <p>
                I would love to have been able to add additional styling such as fun pictures or creative diagrams to make this site less text
                 based. I think it would have been really interesting to use Sass scripting language as it is more object oriented which would 
                 appeal to me considering my background of studying Java in college. This is something I will most likely work on when I have 
                 some free time to enhance my own development.
