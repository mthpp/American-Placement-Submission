            <h2> Evaluation of this submission project: </h2>

            <p>Although it was brilliant to be allowed to submit an application for this placement having missed
                the original deadline, I feel like I would have benefited immensely from the extra time. It was
                difficult to manage putting together this application and preparing for our product launch in a 
                short time period. However, this was definitely a worthwhile project.
            </p>

            <h3> Things I would improve next time: </h3>
            <p>
                Under more flexible time constraints I would have used the Bootstrap framework in order to implement a grid system and make
                the styling of this website more efficient. I am more familiar with CSS but I would have enjoyed learning more about how to
                implement Bootstrap styles. Initially I experimented with using the modern flex box system to style the pages but this wasn't a
                viable option because of the positioning of some of the page components. 
            </p>                
            <p>
                I would love to have been able to add additional styling such as fun pictures or creative diagrams to make this site less text
                 based. I think it would have been really interesting to use Sass scripting language as it is more object oriented which would 
                 appeal to me considering my background of studying Java in college. This is something I will most likely work on when I have 
                 some free time to enhance my own development.
            </p>
