    <p>My time at Allstate has given me some of the most enjoyable experiences in my life. The thing I love most 
    about the job is how collaborative the atmosphere in the lab is. Someone is always on hand to help out if 
    you need them and they never make it seem like a chore.</p>
    
    <p>I also really love the learning culture the company encourages with all the Learn Days, Lunch &amp; Learns 
       and talks frequently available, not to mention the additional resources available for people who want to 
       expand their knowledge eg. Pluralsight courses. It really impresses me that so much emphasis is put on 
       continous improvement. </p>
    
    <p>As you can see from the way I have turned this submission into an chance to further improve my HTML and CSS 
       skills and learn how to use Github with Windows (since we operate on MACs in CompoZed) continuous improvement 
       is something I also strive for.
