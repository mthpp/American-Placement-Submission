            <h2> My Time at Allstate:</h2>

            <p>My time at Allstate has given me some of the most enjoyable experiences in my life. The thing I love most 
            about the job is how collaborative the atmosphere in the lab is. Someone is always on hand to help if 
            you need them and they never make it seem like a chore.</p>
            
            <p>I also really love the learning culture the company encourages with all the Learn Days, Lunch &amp; Learns 
            and talks frequently available, not to mention the additional resources available for people who want to 
            expand their knowledge eg. Pluralsight courses. It really impresses me that so much emphasis is put on 
            continous improvement. </p>

            <p>Another thing I really appreciated was how everyone treated me as an equal. My ideas were always considered 
                and explored. This is something that is very encouraging for people who are just starting out in a career. </p>
            
            <p>As you can see from the way I have turned this submission into a chance to further improve my HTML and CSS 
            skills and learn how to use Github with Windows (since we operate on MACs in CompoZed) continuous improvement 
            is something I also strive for. Due to the time constraints, I was again able to see the benefits of using Agile
             methodology to develop this project. I used the concept of first getting the basic functionality and content 
             up and running and then adding extra features.

            </div>
            <p>During my time with Allstate I have been involved in the product life cycle from start to finish through the
                 development of CompEdu. This product is something which really demonstrates my abilities and it is 
                 great to have something tangible to present in the future to illustrate my learnings.<p/>
