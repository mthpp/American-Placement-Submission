          <h2> Introduction: </h2>

          <p> Welcome! I coded a website for this submission to further demonstrate why you should choose 
          me for this role. I have now been working in CompoZed Northland for 9 weeks. The opportunity
          to work here during the summer while many of my classmates are taking a break from their studies 
          has been invaluable to me. I am immensely grateful to Allstate for offering such a great learning platform 
          for dedicated students such as myself. </p>

          <p> I have always had a very logical mind, initially this directed me to Science. After finishing Secondary school,
          I went on to study Bioscience at LYIT and received good grades. I realised after some time that this was not quite the path I was looking 
          for. However, I believe this sort of technical based environment was still valuable to my learning today. At 
          the time, the thought of going into programming had never occurred to me, after all; it's not something we are told 
          about in school. On the other hand, I had always admired my uncle who had completed several degrees and courses in 
          Computing and worked for many IT related roles with multiple companies. Whenever anyone in my family had an IT related problem they
          would go him. To me, it seemed like he had an endless wealth of knowledge in this area. I loved learning about 
          technology from him and had always picked up Computing tips and tricks quickly while others in the family 
          struggled.</p>

          <p> This was one of the things that encouraged me to apply for the course I am currently studying. Starting this course 
          was a revelation to me. Science wasn't where my interest lay but Computing was a whole new ballgame. I really loved all my classes and
          I was so eager to learn that I would study for hours and it wouldn't even seem like work because I was genuinely 
          interested in what I was doing. I now know from personal experience what a major difference this makes and this is one
          of the attributes I would bring with me should you choose me for one of these positions.  
          </p>

          <p> Having never been to the United States, the idea of being able to work for Allstate again; not only in a role I love
          but in a new cultural environment really appeals to me. I want to gain as much knowledge as I can and I have no doubt 
          that I would be able to learn even more about programming in general abroad. This is also why I am currently considering
          spending a portion of my third year in college studying in Vienna, Austria.</p>
