    <h2> Quotes and testimonials on my abilities:</h2>
    <br>
    <blockquote>Maria has grown since she joined the Northland CompoZed lab.  Her verbal and communication skills have improved 
            as she regularly contributes in daily standup, IPM and retrospective sessions.  She questions and is eager to 
            learn.  Maria has embraced the CompoZed culture - learning the XP methodology and is involved in daily pairing. 
            Maria has taken a problem from Ideation into Scoping, validated the assumptions by leading Discovery and Framing 
            sessions, synthesized data and brought findings to Inception to support the formation of an MVP.  As part of a 
            team she worked to learn React.js and delivered daily stories as part of product development.  Maria continuously 
            learned throughout this journey and has a very positive attitude. The culmination of the work to deliver an MVP 
            and launch a product is a testament to Maria's skills and how she has evolved and iterated in her own development 
            during her time in our lab.  In my opinion Maria would be an asset to any team and I would highly recommend her.</blockquote>
    <p class= 'quoter'> - Emma McLaughlin, Product Manager. </p>
    <blockquote>"Even at this early stage, I can see you have the right mind for programming and I don't give
        out compliments easily."</blockquote> 
    <p class= 'quoter'> - Gary Cullen, Programming lecturer at LYIT, Year 1, Week 3. </p>
    <blockquote>"You will have no problem with this. You're top of the class and one of the star pupils in the
                year. You always pay attention, you know the material well and you have the drive to achieve. I know
                you'll go far."</blockquote> 
    <p class= 'quoter'> - Michael Mc Cann, Operating Systems lecturer at LYIT <br> (after I had asked him a
                        question about an upcoming continuous assessment exam). </p>
    <blockquote>"You were our top scorer, you were very good."</blockquote> 
    <p class= 'quoter'> - Gina O' Leary, Global CompoZed director, referring to my bursary interview. </p>
