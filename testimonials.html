        out compliments easily."</blockquote>

    <blockquote>"You will have no problem with this. You're top of the class and one of the star pupils in the
                year. You always pay attention, you know the material well and you have the drive to achieve. I know
                you'll go far."</blockquote> 
    <p class= 'quoter'> - Michael Mc Cann, Operating Systems lecturer at LYIT <br> (after I had asked him a
                        question about an upcoming continuous assessment exam). </p>
