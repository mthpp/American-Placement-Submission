            <h2> Quotes and testimonials on my abilities:</h2>
            <blockquote>"Maria has grown since she joined the Northland CompoZed lab.  Her verbal and communication skills have improved 
                    as she regularly contributes in daily standup, IPM and retrospective sessions. She questions and is eager to 
                    learn. Maria has embraced the CompoZed culture - learning the XP methodology and is involved in daily pairing. 
                    Maria has taken a problem from Ideation into Scoping, validated the assumptions by leading Discovery and Framing 
                    sessions, synthesized data and brought findings to Inception to support the formation of an MVP. As part of a 
                    team she worked to learn ReactJS and delivered daily stories as part of product development.  Maria continuously 
                    learned throughout this journey and has a very positive attitude. The culmination of the work to deliver an MVP 
                    and launch a product is a testament to Maria's skills and how she has evolved and iterated in her own development 
                    during her time in our lab. In my opinion Maria would be an asset to any team and I would highly recommend her."</blockquote>
            <p class= 'quoter'> - Emma McLaughlin, Product Manager at Allstate Northland. </p>
            <blockquote>"I have been working as Maria's mentor during her time in CompoZed labs. Maria has turned out to be a great addition to the team.  
                    Maria's role within the team has required her to learn a number of new technologies over a short space of time and I have found that she has 
                    been a quick learner and has adapted to her role with ease. Maria is a talented hard-working individual who will continue to grow as she becomes 
                    more experienced in her career and I would gladly recommend her as she has been a great asset to the team."</blockquote>
                <p class= 'quoter'> - Ciaran Concannon, Internship Mentor and Developer at Allstate Northland. </p>
                <blockquote>"I paired with Maria on some concepts completely new to her and was very impressed by her speed of understanding. Maria very quickly 
                    reached a level where she made genuine contribution. However it was Maria’s enthusiasm and confidence combined with a maturity to collaborate 
                    that will guarantee her success in future endeavours."</blockquote>
                <p class= 'quoter'> - David Stewart, Developer at Allstate Northland. </quoter> 
            <blockquote>"You were our top scorer, you were very good."</blockquote> 
                <p class= 'quoter'> - Gina O' Leary, CompoZed Global Lab Director, referring to my bursary interview. </p>
            <blockquote>"Even at this early stage, I can see you have the right mind for programming and I don't give
                out compliments easily."</blockquote> 
            <p class= 'quoter'> - Gary Cullen, Programming lecturer at LYIT, Year 1, Week 3. </p>
            <blockquote>"You will have no problem with this. You're top of the class and one of the star pupils in the
                        year. You always pay attention, you know the material well and you have the drive to achieve. I know
                        you'll go far."</blockquote> 
            <p class= 'quoter'> - Michael McCann, Operating Systems lecturer at LYIT <br> (after I had asked him a
                                question about an upcoming continuous assessment exam). </p>
            <h2> Recommendation: </h2>
            <blockquote> "After Maria joined the CompoZed lab in Northland she worked on several different teams. Maria proved to be proficient at picking up the languages, 
                technologies &amp; libraries used by each team.<br><br>
                While on the “SMCE Manage My Staff” product, Maria rotated pairs and paired very well with everyone. Maria quickly picked up the high-level concepts and 
                asked appropriate questions while pairing, which delivered the best solution for our customers. Maria adopted the XP values &amp; work practices while 
                demonstrating an understanding of the underlying Agile principles.<br><br>
                    
                <div class="tech">Some of the main technologies, libraries and frameworks used included:</div><br>   
                Node.js (Server-side JavaScript runtime)<br>
                    Expressjs (web application framework)<br>
                    JavaScript (server and client-side)<br>
                    git &amp; github<br>
                    CloudBees Jenkins for CI (Continuous Integration) &amp; CD (Continuous Deployment)<br>
                    Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PAAS - Platform As A Service)<br>
                    mocha, chai, supertest, codeceptjs for testing<br>
                    ReactJS, SQL (MSSQL), Bootstrap, JQuery, CSS, Enzyme (For react testing)<br><br>
                    
                    Maria has a natural curiosity that is a requirement for every successful technologist. Maria worked well both as part of a team &amp; individually.<br>
                    
                    Maria &amp; another intern worked on a new product called CompEdu.  They went through the complete lifecycle from Ideation, through Discovery &amp; Framing,
                     Scoping, Inception, Execution and Release as a pair of XP Full Stack Software Engineers &amp; delivered MVP in under 5 weeks. This is a huge achievement for any
                      product team - considering this was done by a pair of 1st year interns makes the accomplishment even greater.<br><br>
                    
                    I believe Maria would be a valuable asset to whatever company manages to hire her. I would welcome the opportunity to work with Maria in the future."
